# Developer Document

This document is mainly developer documentation, describing the interface, configuration, parameters, etc. There are three parts:

- API of federated learning: We provide APIs to access job scheduler and model manager components to manage federated jobs and models. All the interfaces comply with the HTTP protocol.
- Client SDK: The SDK provides a way to interact with the federated framework. It is used to facilitate users to migrate the center-based programs to federated.
- Component launch configuration: Configuration settings at startup for some components of federated framework.
